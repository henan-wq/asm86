1. Reading Notes for x86 Assembly Language - From Real mode to Protected Mode
2. This is a project for recording my reading notes and answering practice problems.
The title of the book is "x86 Assembly Language - From Real Mode to Protected Mode". I hope to use this book to complete my first OS project.
3. This is also the first time I use GitHub, and I hope it will help me to record the process of completing the whole project.
